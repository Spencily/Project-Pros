A full-stack project built using the Django framework with Python, JavaScript, HTML and CSS. The aim was to create a functional website for users to add deployed projects and github repos that serves as a source of inspiration and help to others, as well as a place where users can celebrate each others achievements.

# ABOUT

<img src="doc-assets/screenshots/Responsiveimage2.png" width="100%" height="100%">

Project Pro is an app for users to celebrate each others' coding achievement, get inspiration from other developers, get tips from our tips section on problems they are currently facing in a project. 

# UX
--
We started with strategy, focusing on the features the target audience would enjoy and find useful.

The target audience for the Project Pro App is:

Professional developers, students

Anyone interested in adding their project on our app

Anyone looking to get tips from the app for a current project or find help for someone else

Anyone looking to have celebrate in a recent milestone they made

These users will be looking for:

A clear and informative website, with intuituve navigation and seeing what the website is at first glance.

A UI/UX that is minimalistic and emphasises the content and theme.

The ability to make a user account in order to add a project.

The ability to log out and login when needed. 

Given the desire to appeal to as broad an audience as possible, UX/UI philosophy will be simple with a focus on content and painless navigation.

# USER STORIES
As a user is the purpose of the app clear at a glance.

As a user can I successfully login/create an account to use the app.

As a user am I notified when I log in and logout.

As a user am I notified when I successfully add a new project on the dashboard.

As a user am I notified when other users like my project.
As a user can I successfully add the github link to my project and the deployed version of my project.

As a user am I directed to another page when I click on the social media links.

As a user can I easily navigate the website through the navbar.

As a user can I easily see other people's projects once i'm logged in.

As a user am I privy to the top tips provided on the website.

# Agile Development

To get the minimum viable product we created a kanban board on github and listed all that needed to be done and moved them in order of todo, in progress, and done as the project progressed. This helped us to keep track of where we were lagging behind and where we were ahead.

# WIREFRAMES
All wireframes were created using Balsamiq.

The navigation bar appears on every page allowing users to easily navigate through the site.
Navigation bar has links for 'Home', 'Logout' and 'Login/Register'.
Logged in users will also have a 'Logout' and 'home' button highlighted in the navbar.

# Structure
This website is made of two apps: The Project App which handles the functions linked to adding the project, and another app for the tips.

# Testing and Validation

# Responsiveness
We used the dev tools on chrome to test the website for responsiveness. We captured screenshots to demonstrate responsive design across mobile, tablet and laptop using UI Dev. On smaller screens the screen collapses to show a toggle bar for the nav links.

# Testing and Validation
We used the W3 HTML Validator  to check the HTML on each of my site pages by Direct Input. However, the only error pointed out was the django language used.

We used the W3 CSS Validator to check my CSS script by Direct Input. We found no errors!.
